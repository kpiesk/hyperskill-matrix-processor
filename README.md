# hyperskill-matrix-processor
### My Numeric Matrix Processor project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #9

**Covered Topics from the Course:** #59

**About:** This numeric matrix processor is a program which performs a variety of operations including addition, multiplication (matrix multiplication by scalar, and matrices multiplication), four types of transposition, finding the determinant, and inversing the matrix. The program has a user interface which allows the user to select which operation they want to perform and input their own matrices.
