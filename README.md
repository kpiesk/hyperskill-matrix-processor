# hyperskill-matrix-processor
### My Numeric Matrix Processor project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #9

**Covered Topics from the Course:** #59

**About:** This numeric matrix processor is a program which performs a variety of operations including addition, multiplication (matrix multiplication by scalar, and matrices multiplication), four types of transposition, finding the determinant, and inversing the matrix. The program has a user interface which allows the user to select which operation they want to perform and input their own matrices.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and finding solutions to numerous problems, I was learning more about Python syntax and became more confident in working with nested loops and recursion. I gained more knowledge about objects, immutability, identity testing, and default arguments in Python. Furthermore, I learnt a lot about matrices and various operations that can be performed on them, and practiced translating mathematical algorithms to Python code. This project allowed me to use my debugging skills since I needed to utilize PyCharm's debugger to look into why my implemented algorithms weren't working correctly at first.
